COMPULSORY MIGRATION
=========================================================

(1) Mapping multiple files to one in "collate_file" now generates a warning
===========================================================================
If you have

[collate_file]
my_file:some/path/file*

and the expansion matches more than one file created by the test, previously
we have simply taken the first one and proceeded. Now, however, this situation 
generates a warning.

There are three ways to handle this problem:

a) Change the pattern expansion to more specifically point out the file you want
b) Change it to

[collate_file]
my_file*:some/path/file*

so that all the files are collated and added, if multiple ones are present.
c) Suppress the warning using "suppress_stderr_text".


(2) auto_collapse_successful config file entry is no longer used
================================================================
You should just remove it

========================================================
CHANGE IN ENVIRONMENT
========================================================


=========================================================
CHANGES IN DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR (OR PROCEDURE)
=========================================================


(1) All test categories except Failed are now invisible by default
==================================================================
You should use 'show_test_category' to unhide categories. 'hide_test_category' would now only be used for hiding Failed category.

(2) batch_result_repository now stores succeeded tests in a single file
======================================================================
This should make the HTML report faster to generate. To migrate, run e.g.

texttest -b <batch_session> -s batch.MigrateBatchRepository

which will convert the existing repository. Otherwise, just archive from time to time, and the new format will be written,
so gradually migration will occur anyway.

(3) batch_result_repository will be automatically cleaned of old results
========================================================================
The default behaviour of -coll is now to remove all files it doesn't make use of.
This reduces the possibilities of generating long-term data from the repositories, doing data mining etc, but keeps them in trim
without needing to run batch.ArchiveRepository by hand from time to time.

For people who want to keep more historical data, add the new --manualarchive flag when generating the web page, which restores the old
behaviour.

(4) When a viewer program is started in the dynamic GUI, the file is no longer deselected automatically.
========================================================================================================
This long-standing behaviour of TextTest annoyed some users, and being unable to find
anyone to speak up for it, we have removed it.

(1) Due to resurrected support on Windows, the configuration 'unixConfig'
is no longer present or necessary. The few UNIX-specific things left
are inferrred by running the configuration 'default' on a UNIX system.

In other words, if your config file says
config_module:unixConfig

delete this line.

(2) This applies to anyone who was tried to measure CPU time or memory consumption
with texttest. The config file format of most settings has changed.

Because any number of resource-related files can now be extracted, the settings are 
now more like the batch settings, each is a section, with type names. So, for example,
instead of

performance_test_resource:model=Opteron250

you would now write

[performance_test_resource]
cputime:model=Opteron250

Likewise, minimum_cputime_for_test and minimum_memory_for_test are replaced by

[performance_test_minimum]
cputime:10
memory:5

The name 'cputime' for UNIX time-generated CPU time is hardcoded. The rest you can 
set yourself. Use the entry

[performance_logfile_extractor]
memory:Memory Usage Is

to tell TextTest how to create the file from your log file. (This replaces 'string_before_memory'.) The file name 'memory' no longer has any special meaning.

There is also a new entry, that can tell it to use a file other than the one indicated by log_file
for this purpose: as follows.

[performance_logfile]
memory:output

In summary, the changes are follows:

Old names                               New Names
=========                               =========
performance_test_machine (list)         performance_test_machine (section)
performance_test_resource (list)        performance_test_resource (section)
<cputime|memory>_variation_% (int)      performance_variation_% (section)
minimum_<cputime|memory>_for_test (int) performance_test_minimum (section)
string_before_memory (string)           performance_logfile_extractor (section)

Note for migrators (or checkers): check your sections end correctly. If you have global level 
settings after a section, an [end] marker will be needed to make sure that they don't end up 
in the section! Otherwise they will not be included.

(example)

[performance_test_machine]
cputime:apple

config_module:default

(This will not work as config_module will be entered in the section [performance_test_machine]. Use an [end] marker after the section.)

Static GUI Enhancements:
    - Run icon changed to green arrow
Framework Enhancements:
    - New support added for running a window manager under Xvfb. (thanks Mikhail Kalkov/Jeppesen)
    Uses new config variable "virtual_display_wm_executable". 
Batch Report Enhancements:
    - more compact format for repeated host names in HTML tables when tests run on many machines in parallel (thanks Henrik Delin/Jeppesen)
    - new script default.WriteDividedSelections
    The point is to division of a set of tests to allow parallel batch environments even where TextTest's own parallel model cannot run due to lack of reciprical access 
    (e.g. in locked-down corporate Windows environments) 
Grid Engine/Cloud enhancements/bug fixes:
    - support added for Core-binding option in Grid Engine. (thanks Lennart Bengtsson/Jeppesen)
Bug Fixes:
    - handle corrupted Jenkins config.xml files without stacktracing (thanks Jens Kjerrström/Jeppesen)
    - fix problem where "create_catalogues" could not be applied on a per-test basiss (thanks Rikard Lundmark/Jeppesen)
    - expand Git file arguments to full paths, Git does not like symlinks (thanks Wilhelm Hedman/Pagero)
    - Fixed bug where a script that collates multiple files and writes nothing created empty files
    - Handle unreadable teststate files in a generic way

Framework enhancements:
    - Plugin scripts (-s option) will no longer be rejected by the framework if no tests are found (engine.py)
	- sometimes they only act on the application anyway.
    - A couple of config file defaults changed:
	"view_program" now defaults to "emacs" rather than "xemacs" on UNIX, as it is slightly more universally available
	"slow_motion_replay_speed" defaults to 3 instead of 0 (this was more or less a bug)
LSF/SGE enhancements:
    - Unrunnable tests will always report the machine they run on (engine.py)
	Previously some "hard" failures could cause the machine not to be reported
    - performance_test_resource entry now works when machine names in SGE are 'short' (sge.py)
	Previously it only worked if the full domain name was in SGE.
    - If tests report as running but then get terminated hard (e.g. SIGKILL), report them as "killed" (queuesystem.py)
	Previously reported confusingly as "abandoned" - but there was nothing to abandon
    - Finding information in older accounting files in SGE now works (sge.py)
	There has been code lying around to do this for some time but it's never worked until now...
Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed crash on removing tests after starting static GUI from scratch (texttestgui.py,testmodel.py)
	Showed up if the GUI was started with only a config file available.
    - Removing last test from a test suite now removes it from the GUI display also (texttestgui.py)
    - Test completion time on progress bar is now always correct (texttestgui.py)
	It tended to update itself to the current time when clicking around...
    - Collation of files to names containing "." characters is now forbidden (default.py)
	It violates TextTest's naming conventions and hence causes trouble
    - 'Text Info' and 'Viewing' tabs now always appear in the same order (guiplugins.py)
	Viewing tests that were pending in SGE/LSF could cause them to switch before.
    - No longer show spurious files in the static GUI if full temporary path contains "." characters (testmodel.py)
    - External viewers can be started even if the path to the file contains spaces (guiplugins.py)
    - If the script for interpreting core files on UNIX fails, it no longer causes a TextTest crash (predict.py)
    - Fixed crash when an extra_version is rejected for a batch run via batch_version (engine.py)
    - Test data identified by environment variables can now be used as keys in "test_data_searchpath" (default.py)
    - Disable interactive dialogue in console interface after ^C has been pressed (respond.py)
Test Fixes:
    - A certain amount of work done stablising the self-tests and reducing the probability of occasional failures,
      particularly the tests for SGE/LSF.

Some features are easiest to understand by example. For complete newcomers to TextTest it's recommended
to follow the "Getting Started" tutorial and then possibly the "Course Material" which can be seen at
http://www.texttest.org/index.php?page=documentation_trunk. For those who basically know the tool but
want to explore features they haven't used, the self-tests provide a wealth of working examples.

These can be downloaded from source control. Install the Bazaar source control tool and then do
bzr branch lp:/~geoff.bache/texttest/selftest-trunk
See http://www.texttest.org/index.php?page=download for more details.

There are various "TargetApp" directories to be found under it. Each of these contains a test-suite 
for a simple program (which are in turn part of the larger test suite for TextTest, as it tests 
itself testing these programs)

To run these apps by hand, you can view and run them in TextTest:

1) Set the environment variable STANDARD to point at the "standard" file at the top level of the self-tests
2) texttest -d <path to TargetApp> -gx  

What there is to find (below is just a selection):

TargetApp                                  : used by default as it's very basic, this test suite has
                                               one test (that fails) on a "Hello World" program.

TestSelf/TestSelection/TargetApp           : Contains a few tests with related names, to explore the
                                               functionality for selecting tests and saving those selections.

TestSelf/ChangeTestResults/TargetApp       : Contains a few tests that fail in various ways, to explore
                                               how these are reported and how the results can be saved.

TestSelf/RunDependentText/TargetApp        : useful for understanding the run-dependent text filtering

TestSelf/EnvironmentFile/TargetApp         : useful for understanding how environment variables are
