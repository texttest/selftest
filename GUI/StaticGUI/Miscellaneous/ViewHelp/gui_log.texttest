========== Text View ==========
There is almost certainly no migration needed. 

=========================================================
CHANGES IN DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR (OR PROCEDURE)
=========================================================

(1) Dynamic GUI no longer writes to standard output directly
============================================================
It uses the logging mechanism like everything else. To restore the output by
default, copy the log/logging.console file from the TextTest source tree to
$TEXTTEST_PERSONAL_CONFIG/log/logging.gui (i.e. ~/.texttest/log/logging.gui 
unless you repoint the personal configuration directory)

(2) Data file configuration now lives under $TEXTTEST_PERSONAL_CONFIG/etc
=========================================================================
Also for consistency with the log layout. If you have .gtkrc-2.0 or .xml files
for configuring the tool bar in your personal configuration, you'll need to move them
to this subdirectory.

(3) Default "debug" logging file now called logging.debug instead of log4py.conf
================================================================================
For consistency with the above. So you need to go to $TEXTTEST_PERSONAL_CONFIG/log if
you have such a location and do this rename.

'view migration notes in tab' event created with arguments 'from 3.4'

Viewing notebook page for 'from 3.4'
========== Text View ==========
(1) Due to resurrected support on Windows, the configuration 'unixConfig'
is no longer present or necessary. The few UNIX-specific things left
are inferrred by running the configuration 'default' on a UNIX system.

In other words, if your config file says
config_module:unixConfig

delete this line.

(2) This applies to anyone who was tried to measure CPU time or memory consumption
with texttest. The config file format of most settings has changed.

Because any number of resource-related files can now be extracted, the settings are 
now more like the batch settings, each is a section, with type names. So, for example,
instead of

performance_test_resource:model=Opteron250

you would now write

[performance_test_resource]
cputime:model=Opteron250

Likewise, minimum_cputime_for_test and minimum_memory_for_test are replaced by

[performance_test_minimum]
cputime:10
memory:5

The name 'cputime' for UNIX time-generated CPU time is hardcoded. The rest you can 
set yourself. Use the entry

[performance_logfile_extractor]
memory:Memory Usage Is

to tell TextTest how to create the file from your log file. (This replaces 'string_before_memory'.) The file name 'memory' no longer has any special meaning.

There is also a new entry, that can tell it to use a file other than the one indicated by log_file
for this purpose: as follows.

[performance_logfile]
memory:output

In summary, the changes are follows:

Old names                               New Names
=========                               =========
performance_test_machine (list)         performance_test_machine (section)
performance_test_resource (list)        performance_test_resource (section)
<cputime|memory>_variation_% (int)      performance_variation_% (section)
minimum_<cputime|memory>_for_test (int) performance_test_minimum (section)
string_before_memory (string)           performance_logfile_extractor (section)

Note for migrators (or checkers): check your sections end correctly. If you have global level 
settings after a section, an [end] marker will be needed to make sure that they don't end up 
in the section! Otherwise they will not be included.

(example)

[performance_test_machine]
cputime:apple

config_module:default

(This will not work as config_module will be entered in the section [performance_test_machine]. Use an [end] marker after the section.)

========== Text View ==========
General GUI Enhancements:
Dynamic GUI Enhancements:
    - Can now view original files (filtered and not) from the file view popup menu (default_gui.py)
Framework Enhancements:
    - Logging more flexible now (default.py)
	Dynamic GUI does not write anything by default. Batch mode writes time stamps by default.
	Debug logging file now called "logging.debug" rather than "log4py.conf". See migration notes
    - Personal toolbar/GTK configuration now lives in "etc" subdirectory (plugins.py)
	Mostly to keep things consistent with "log" locations

'view change logs in tab' event created with arguments '3.7.1'

Viewing notebook page for '3.7.1'
========== Text View ==========
Framework enhancements:
    - Plugin scripts (-s option) will no longer be rejected by the framework if no tests are found (engine.py)
	- sometimes they only act on the application anyway.
    - A couple of config file defaults changed: 
	"view_program" now defaults to "emacs" rather than "xemacs" on UNIX, as it is slightly more universally available
	"slow_motion_replay_speed" defaults to 3 instead of 0 (this was more or less a bug)
LSF/SGE enhancements:
    - Unrunnable tests will always report the machine they run on (engine.py)
	Previously some "hard" failures could cause the machine not to be reported
    - performance_test_resource entry now works when machine names in SGE are 'short' (sge.py)
	Previously it only worked if the full domain name was in SGE.
    - If tests report as running but then get terminated hard (e.g. SIGKILL), report them as "killed" (queuesystem.py)
	Previously reported confusingly as "abandoned" - but there was nothing to abandon
    - Finding information in older accounting files in SGE now works (sge.py)
	There has been code lying around to do this for some time but it's never worked until now...
Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed crash on removing tests after starting static GUI from scratch (texttestgui.py,testmodel.py)
	Showed up if the GUI was started with only a config file available.
    - Removing last test from a test suite now removes it from the GUI display also (texttestgui.py)
    - Test completion time on progress bar is now always correct (texttestgui.py)
	It tended to update itself to the current time when clicking around...
    - Collation of files to names containing "." characters is now forbidden (default.py)
	It violates TextTest's naming conventions and hence causes trouble
    - 'Text Info' and 'Viewing' tabs now always appear in the same order (guiplugins.py)
	Viewing tests that were pending in SGE/LSF could cause them to switch before.
    - No longer show spurious files in the static GUI if full temporary path contains "." characters (testmodel.py)
    - External viewers can be started even if the path to the file contains spaces (guiplugins.py)
    - If the script for interpreting core files on UNIX fails, it no longer causes a TextTest crash (predict.py)
    - Fixed crash when an extra_version is rejected for a batch run via batch_version (engine.py)
    - Test data identified by environment variables can now be used as keys in "test_data_searchpath" (default.py)
    - Disable interactive dialogue in console interface after ^C has been pressed (respond.py)
Test Fixes:
    - A certain amount of work done stablising the self-tests and reducing the probability of occasional failures, 
      particularly the tests for SGE/LSF.
